#What you can do:

* It is possible to sign up for an account, please use a strong password.

* Once an account is created you get access to all these tools:

* You can use this app to keep an overview of your monthly/yearly expenses and income with help from graphics.

* See how much you spend for different categories, like groceries, entertaiment, child support etc.

* You can add your own categories if you like. You may also edit them or delete them.

* The information is stored on a database, and will be deleted if you chose to do so.

* You are also able to edit transactions or delete them.

* One major advantage is that you can split transactions into different categories.
